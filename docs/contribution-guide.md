5. **Test Thoroughly**: Try it on different codebases

### Designing Chat Modes

1. **Define Purpose Clearly**: What specific problem does this solve?
2. **Set Appropriate Boundaries**: What should this mode NOT do?
3. **Choose Tools Wisely**: Only include tools that are actually needed
4. **Consider User Experience**: How does this improve developer workflow?
5. **Plan for Evolution**: How might this mode need to change over time?

## üö´ Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Content Issues

- **Poor Examples**: Examples that don't clearly illustrate the point

### Technical Issues

- **Invalid Frontmatter**: YAML syntax errors or missing required fields
- **Wrong File Extensions**: Using incorrect file naming conventions
- **Poor Organization**: Files in the wrong directories
- **Broken Markdown**: Syntax errors that prevent proper rendering
- **Missing Testing**: Submitting untested content

### Process Issues

- **Inadequate Description**: PR descriptions that don't explain the contribution
- **Missing Documentation**: Not updating relevant docs when needed
- **Ignoring Feedback**: Not addressing review comments
- **Rushing Submission**: Not taking time to polish and test
- **Poor Commit Messages**: Vague or unhelpful commit descriptions
