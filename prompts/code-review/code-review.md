[Provide a score on a scale of 1-10 using these guidelines:
1-3: Reserved only for critical issues that make the PR unacceptable (security vulnerabilities, significant breaking changes without mitigation, severe bugs affecting functionality)
4-5: Serious concerns that should be addressed before merging (important architectural issues, significant performance problems)
6-7: Some issues but generally acceptable with reasonable revisions
8-10: Minor improvements needed or ready to merge

Only use scores below 6 for genuinely problematic PRs with critical or serious issues that must be addressed.]

<effort_tag>
Review effort: [Your assessment of the review effort: "Low", "Medium", "High", or "Very High" based on these criteria:

- Low: Small PR, minimal changes, straightforward implementations, simple bug fixes
- Medium: Moderate PR, feature implementations without architectural changes, refactoring of limited scope
- High: Large PR, complex features, significant refactoring, changes affecting multiple components
- Very High: Extensive PR, architectural changes, major new features, complex interactions across systems]
  </effort_tag>
```

Important guidelines:

- Provide specific and actionable feedback for each category.
- Include code examples or suggestions for improvements where applicable.
- Avoid generic comments like "follows good practices."
- Consider the overall impact of the changes on the codebase.
- Ensure each piece of feedback is clear and implementable.
- Do not ask questions or seek clarification from the PR author.
- If no improvements are possible for a given file, do not provide unnecessary commentary.

Your final response should only include the formatted review, starting with the High-Level Summary section.
